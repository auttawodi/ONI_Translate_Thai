Klei developed and owns the Game, and is licensing the Game to you on the terms and conditions set out below.  Klei is not selling the Game to you.

Subject to this Agreement, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, limited right and licence to access and use the Game for your personal non-commercial gameplay.
You may download information, images, artwork, text, video, audio, pictures and other materials from the Game to the extent necessary to access and use the Game for the purposes of this Agreement.  However, you must not otherwise copy, reproduce, republish, post, transmit, display, perform, distribute, modify, translate, reverse-engineer, reverse-compile or decompile, disassemble or create any derivative work from any of those materials or any other portion of the Game without our prior written approval.
We, and our licensors, reserve all rights not specifically granted to you in this Agreement.

3. OWNERSHIP
The Game is protected by copyright law and by national and international laws, treaties and conventions.
As between you and us, we own all right, title and interest in the Game, including all computer code, titles, text, images, animations, artwork, audio, video, designs, sounds, themes, objects, characters, character names, stories, dialogue, concepts and trade-marks, the graphical design of the user interface, the “look-and-feel” of the user interface, all modifications, customizations and additions thereto, and all intellectual property rights therein.  Our names and logos are our trade-marks and you must not use any of them without our consent. Except as expressly set out in this Agreement, you acquire no license to, or other rights in, the Game.
 
4. GAME ACCOUNT
To access and use the game you must have a user account (“Account”).  You agree to provide accurate and complete information when establishing and updating your Account. You are solely responsible for keeping your Account password secure and confidential. We will never ask you for your password. You are solely responsible and liable for all activity conducted through your Account (whether authorized by you or not), and for maintaining your Account in good standing. You will immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your Account, user name or password. You agree that you will never use another person’s Game account.
We will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from the unauthorized use of your Account. However, you may be liable for our losses or the losses of others due to such unauthorized use.
The Game is currently accessible only through Google Chrome, and you must have a Google account to access and play the Game. You acknowledge and agree that your Google account is provided and managed by Google, not by us, and that your creation and use of that Google account are subject to Google’s applicable terms and conditions and privacy policies.
We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to terminate or suspend your Account if we believe, or have been notified by a third party of its belief, that you may be infringing the rights of others, violating the copyrights of others, or engaging in any inappropriate behavior. We also reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to terminate your access to all or part of the Game or to any product or service available through the Game or any Klei website for any reason or no reason, with or without notice. In the event of termination, your Account will be disabled, and you will not have access to your Account. You should be aware that, if your Account is terminated, we may not be able to return your content to you and that you may not otherwise have access to your content, although residual copies of such information may remain in our system for back-up purposes and for compliance with legal reporting obligations.
 
5. AGE
The Game is available only to individuals who are of legal age to form a binding contract. The Game may be used by an individual older than 13 but younger than 19 only with express authorization from that individual’s parent or legal guardian. Subject to the laws of your jurisdiction of residence, individuals older than 13 but younger than 19 may only access and use the Game through an account established by, and with the approval of, their parents or legal guardians. If you permit your minor child or legal ward to use your Account to access and use the Game, you agree to this Agreement on your behalf and on behalf of your minor child or legal ward, and you understand and agree that you will be responsible for all use of your Account by your minor child or legal ward regardless of whether you authorized that use (including the purchase of items for which we charge a fee).
You hereby confirm that you are at least 19 years of age, are of the age of majority in the jurisdiction from which you access the Game, and are an individual who can form a legally binding contract.
 
6. INTERRUPTIONS, ERRORS AND DOWNTIME
Your use of the Game might be interrupted and will not be free of errors.
The Game may be unavailable from time to time due to routine maintenance, upgrades, hardware and software malfunctions, repairs, power outages, hackers, denial of service attacks and unforeseeably large service demands. Where reasonably possible we will give you prior notice of any scheduled service interruptions.
 
7. PRIVACY
We respect your privacy and only collect, use and disclose your personal information as described in our Privacy Policy and in this Agreement. You hereby consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Agreement and our Privacy Policy.
You consent to our collection, use and disclosure of your name, contact information and other personal information to the extent necessary or desirable for us to communicate with you, monitor your compliance with this Agreement, and manage the Game.  We may use aggregate, non-identifiable information about Game players for promotional and advertising purposes.  We do not sell your personal information to third parties.  If we suspect you of fraudulent or other criminal activities, we may disclose your personal information to the police or other authorities.  We will not otherwise disclose your personal information except as permitted or required by law.
 
8. PAYMENT
You do not have to pay to play the Game, though we reserve the right to charge fees to play the Game in the future.
If you wish to obtain a product or service through or in connection with the Game that requires you to pay a fee, you will pay all applicable fees by credit card or a third-party electronic payment processors and/or financial institutions (“EPPs”). You irrevocably authorize us, as necessary, to instruct EPPs to process your payments, and you irrevocably agree that we may give such instructions on your behalf in accordance with your requests as submitted using the relevant Game features.  You agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of use of each applicable EPP; if there is a conflict between this Agreement and the EPP’s terms and conditions, this Agreement will prevail.
We will suspend your access to the product or service if you do not pay, or if your credit card expires or denies payment. In order to process your payments, you must provide us or the EPP with certain personal information, and you hereby consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information necessary for those purposes.
IF YOU DISPUTE ANY CHARGES RELATING TO THE GAME OR TO PRODUCTS OR SERVICES AVAILABLE THROUGH OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE GAME, YOU MUST NOTIFY US IN WRITING WITHIN 30 DAYS AFTER THE DATE OF THE CHARGE. Your failure to notify us within that period will constitute your waiver of any claim relating to the disputed charge.
 
9. VIRTUAL PROPERTY
You have no property interest in any virtual currency, items or other property (collectively “Virtual Property”) that you obtain or purchase through or in connection with the Game. Any purchase or acquisition of Virtual Property is the purchase of a limited, non-transferable, revocable licence to use that Virtual Property within the Game. You may not transfer or resell Virtual Property for commercial gain. Virtual Property has no monetary value, and cannot be refunded or exchanged for cash or any other tangible value. If your Account is terminated or suspended for any reason, or if we discontinue the Game, all Virtual Property is unconditionally forfeited.
We have no liability for hacking or loss of your Virtual Property, and we have no obligation to (and will not) reimburse you for any Virtual Property lost due to your breach of this Agreement.

You are solely responsible for obtaining and maintaining all computer equipment and Internet connections required to access and use the Game, at your sole expense.  We do not guarantee that the Game will not conflict with other programs on your computer, and we will not be responsible for the workings or failures of your computer equipment, network, software or Internet access.  The performance and proper functioning of the Game may be reduced or prevented if you are simultaneously using other software, and we recommend that you turn off any such programs when using the Game.

To assist in these security reviews, you agree to provide such information or documentation as we may request from time to time in our sole discretion.  If, after conducting a security review, we determine in our sole discretion that you have not complied with this Agreement, or that you have not provided timely satisfactory responses to inquiries made in the security review, we may terminate or suspend your access to the Game.
 
14. CONSENT TO MONITORING
When you are using the Game, the Game may monitor your computer’s random access memory (RAM) for unauthorized third-party programs that interact with the Game and are prohibited by this Agreement. If the Game detects an unauthorized third-party program, the Game may, without notice to you, communicate that information to us, including your Account information, your internet protocol (IP) address, details about the unauthorized third-party program, and the time and date that the unauthorized third-party program was detected. If the Game detects the use of an unauthorized third-party program, your access to the Game may be terminated. You hereby consent to this monitoring.
